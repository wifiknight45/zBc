# Postpaid Billing Date Calculator (v2.1)

This interactive tool calculates key billing dates for postpaid wireless customers based on a provided billing cycle start date (MM/DD/YYYY). The script also optionally encrypts the billing data using AES-256 GCM encryption.

## Features
- Computes billing dates including:
  - Billing Cycle Start
  - Bill display in Tlife App (4 days later)
  - Bill PDF Ready (10 days later)
  - Funds Available Pre-Autopay (16 days later)
  - Autopay Draft (18 days later)
  - Bill Is Due (20 days later)
  - Billing Cycle Close (30 days later)
  - Service Suspension Risk (37 days later)
  - Number Loss Risk (90 days later)
- Option to encrypt the billing data.
- Interactive interface designed primarily for Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, or compatible IDEs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `cryptography` library (install via: `pip install cryptography`)

## Changelog: v2.1
- Fixed a syntax error by adding a comma after `"bill_pdf_ready"` in the `calculate_billing_dates()` function.
- Corrected a typo (`dateime` â†’ `datetime`) in the calculation of `"bill_is_due"`.
- Updated the docstring to reflect the correct key naming for billing date entries.

## Usage
1. Run the script in your interactive environment.
2. Select the mode: `calculate` to compute billing dates or `decrypt` to decrypt an existing encrypted JSON file.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the necessary data and optionally save the results to a file.
