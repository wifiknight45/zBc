# Postpaid Billing Date Calculator (v3.1-beta)

This interactive tool calculates key billing dates for postpaid wireless customers based on a provided billing cycle start date (MM/DD/YYYY). It now projects billing milestones for the current cycle and the next 4 months, then lists all milestones sorted from the closest to farthest away in number of days from the input date. Optional AES-256 GCM encryption of the output is supported.

## Features
- Computes billing milestones including:
  - Billing Cycle Start
  - Bill in Tlife App (4 days later)
  - Bill PDF Ready (10 days later)
  - Funds Available Pre-Autopay (16 days later)
  - Autopay Draft (18 days later)
  - Bill Is Due (20 days later)
  - Billing Cycle Close (30 days later)
  - Service Suspension Risk (37 days later)
  - Number Loss Risk (90 days later)
- Generates projections for the next 4 months (total of 5 cycles: current + 4 projections).
- Displays all milestones sorted by the number of days from the input date.
- Optional encryption of billing/projection data using AES-256 GCM.
- Interactive interface designed for Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, or any compatible IDE.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `cryptography` library (install via: `pip install cryptography`)

## Changelog: v3.1-beta
- Added projections for the next 4 months using an `add_months` helper function.
- Aggregated all milestones (current and projected) and printed them sorted by days from the start date.
- Introduced helper functions: `add_months`, `format_projection_data`, and `encrypt_projection_data`.
- Updated the encryption workflow to support the new projections.

## Usage
1. Run the script in your interactive environment.
2. When prompted in "calculate" mode, input the billing cycle start date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
3. The system computes the billing milestones for the current cycle and the next 4 months, then displays them sorted by the number of days from the start date.
4. Optionally, choose to encrypt the output and/or save it to a file.
5. To decrypt a previously saved encrypted file, use the "decrypt" mode.
