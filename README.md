### Summary

# zBc – A lightweight yet powerful Python script designed to streamline key billing date calculations for post-paid wireless customers. By taking a single input date, zBc intelligently determines crucial billing milestones within the carrier's cycle, such as billing start dates, due dates, grace periods, and payment deadlines, ensuring users stay ahead of their financial obligations.

For those who prioritize security, zBc offers AES-256 GCM encryption, providing a highly secure method to handle sensitive billing data without compromising performance. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, this script eliminates the guesswork in billing cycles while keeping operations smooth and automated.

Whether you're a consumer looking for better billing clarity or an Account Associate aiming to optimize workflow, zBc is a reliable, low-footprint solution that gets the job done with minimal setup.

cool nerd stuff about the script:
- Scalability: The code is modular and uses the `argparse` library for command-line flexibility. Functions like `calculate_billing_dates` can be imported into larger systems.
- Security: The script implements AES-256 encryption (using AESGCM) and secure key derivation via PBKDF2.
- Open Source & Extensible:Written in Python with clear documentation and inline comments to help opensource developers integrate or extend functionality in enterprise telecomunications applications. 
- Telecommunications Tailoring: Specifically configured to calculate the billing milestones for post-paid (i.e. bill current) customers.
- 
Disclaimer: This script is just a helpful tool—nothing official, no corporate ties. It’s here to make life a little easier by highlighting key billing dates, but it comes as is—no promises, no guarantees. Use it at your own discretion, and if you need the real deal on billing, always check with your provider. Enjoy, and keep things easy. ;-)
